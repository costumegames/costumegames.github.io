<p>From a single day event six years ago, Brighton Japan has&nbsp;expanded exponentially, becoming the largest annual celebration of Japanese culture in Europe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013 the festival outgrew its home in Bartholomew Square and&nbsp;took over&nbsp;the prestigious and historically significant site of the Old Steine Gardens in the heart of the city for a full ten days, cementing its reputation as one of the most important fixtures&nbsp;in the city's busy festival calendar.</p>
<p>Located on the main thoroughfare into Brighton and a stone's throw from the Palace Pier and the seafront, the Old Steine Gardens have an estimated footfall of a hundred thousand per day.*&nbsp;</p>
<p>2015 will see the festival change its name to The Costume Games. Although still inspired by the Japanese phenomenon of "Japanese Street Fashion" and Cosplay, the festival will broaden its appeal to other forms of dressing up.</p>
<p>The highlight of The Costume Games will be the Cosplay Costume Carnival - a Carnival, themed on "Superheroes" which will proceed through the streets of Brighton on Saturday 19th.</p>
<p>We are honoured to have Graham Churchyard, special effects costume designer for Batman and the Harry Potter movies, as our consultant for the Cosplay Costume Carnival.</p>
