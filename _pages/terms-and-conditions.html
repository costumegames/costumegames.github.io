<h2>The Costume Games Policy on Weapons and Props</h2>
The Costume Games will not allow ANY real weapons onto the site.

We understand that some of our attendees would desire to bring in prop and replica weapons in order to accurately portray their chosen characters. We would ask those so doing to adhere to some basic rules for the safety and enjoyment of all participants.

We do not allow:-

*Any replica weapons that are banned or subject to any restrictions from being carried or sold in this country.

*Any prop or replica weapons that are allowable but we deem to be being used in an unsafe way or in a way that is disturbing others at the event.

This ruling is not applicable to contributors associated with The Costume Games who are running demonstrations and workshops and have been vetted by show organisers.


<h2>Food and Drink Policy</h2>

Only food and drink purchased at the event may be consumed at the event.
