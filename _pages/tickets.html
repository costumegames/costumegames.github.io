<div>Yippee! Entry to the "Costume Gardens" on the Old Steine is TOTALLY AND UTTERLY FREE!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>...but there will be some events (such as the films and stage fighting workshops) inside The Costume Gardens for which there will be a small charge of around &pound;5. Please buy them below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are expecting to be very, very busy, and a queuing system into The Costume Gardens will be in place if we reach 1,500 people. If you want to ensure entry, gain priority access to all the events, and wish to book for our exclusive masterclasses and workshops, we strongly suggest you buy one of our two VIP Festival passes.</div>
