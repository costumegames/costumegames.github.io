<p>We're thinking big for The Costume Games&nbsp;2015. A full programme of&nbsp;films, supper clubs, events, workshops, performances and concerts will culminate in the world's first ever <strong>Costume Carnival</strong> on the 19th September, which will involve&nbsp;hundreds of dressed up&nbsp;people&nbsp;proceeding along Madeira Drive as part of the opening weekend of Rugby World Cup 2015. We're also thrilled to be able to announce that street artists Lady Aiko will be taking up residancy for the festival, creating world-class street art around the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;would like to perform, exhibit, or take part in The Costume Games, please <a href="../../contact.html">get in touch with us</a>!</p>
