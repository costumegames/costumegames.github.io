<p>&ldquo;The Costume Games&rdquo; has grown out of the successful Brighton Japan festival, which over five years played host to what is now the largest outdoor Cosplay event in the UK. The festival has been developed with Brighton &amp; Hove City Council to celebrate the opening weekend of Rugby World Cup 2015, and is supported with a grant from Rugby World Cup 2015's "spectaculars" budget.</p>
<p>Rugby World Cup 2015 will be promoting The Costume Games as one of the principal opening weekend events in their UK wide Festival of Rugby. We want the whole city of Brighton to get involved to make this a truly memorable event!</p>
