<p>We're incredibly excited that Costume effects innovators FBFX will be down for The Costume Games with this one hour long Armour Masterclass. A Leather demo will follow at 3pm.</p>

If you wish to be able to book a place at this session, you will need to purchase a VIP Festival pass, which will give you free entry into all of the ticketed events (except for the MOSHIMO Supper Club) and will allow you to book at any of the free events.</span></p>
