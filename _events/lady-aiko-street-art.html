<p>Some of the leading street artists in the world are coming to The Costume Games to paint the city!</p>

<p>The phenomenal Lady Aiko will take up residency in the city for ten days, care of Art Republic. She'll be running workshops, creating pieces of public art around the city, and will then curate the opening festivities of The Costume Games on Wednesday 16th September when we will be inviting you help her to transform the Old Steine Gardens into our Costume City.  If you wish to take part in these, please join our mailing list here.</p>
