<p>This one hour demo will inspire you to build incredible, high impact looks and effects as well as explore wild, outrageous make-up with extreme, exaggerated shapes. This masterclass also gives insight into Illamasqua&rsquo;s Drag &amp; Manga Make-Up Course, with Tonee giving&nbsp;a taster on how to master pigments, brow blocking, statement brows, feature exaggeration, colour cartooning and lash effects.</p>
<p>After the masterclass, guests will also have a chance to chat one-to-one with Tonee.</p>

If you wish to be able to book a place at this session, you will need to purchase a VIP Festival pass, which will give you free entry into all of the ticketed events (except for the MOSHIMO Supper Club) and will allow you to book at any of the free events.</span></p>
