<p>This one hour demo sees creativity explode which will inspire you to build incredible, high impact looks and effects as well as explore wild, outrageous make-up with extreme, exaggerated shapes. This masterclass also gives insight into Illamasqua&rsquo;s Drag &amp; Manga Make-Up Course, with Tonee demoing a taster on how to master pigments, brow blocking, statement brows, feature exaggeration, colour cartooning and lash effects.</p>
<p>After the masterclass, guests will also have a chance to chat one-to-one with Tonee.</p>
