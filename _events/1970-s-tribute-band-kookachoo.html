<p>We trawled the country high and low for the most outrageous tribute band we could find to turn our Costume Games Party on Saturday 19th into the party of the year&hellip; and we found them!</p>
<p>The Costume Games, in association with MOSHIMO, are proud to announce Liverpool&rsquo;s extraordinary 70&prime;s Glam Rock Tribute Show, KooKaChoo.</p>
<p>Koo Ka Choo have supported Slade, Alvin Stardust, Showaddywaddy, Tony Hadley, Dr &amp; The Medics, Boney M and The Real Thing amongst others&hellip;and have themselves been supported by Liverpool Express and The Nolans.</p>
<p>10pm, 19th Saturday.</p>
<p>Free entry (as long as you are in costume!)</p>
<p>The Costume Games, Old Steine Gardens, Brighton</p>
