<p>MORE ABOUT GLADRAGS</p>
<p>Gladrags is a unique resource providing costumes to a range of community groups, schools and health and wellbeing projects at very low cost. Our hire of fun party/ festival outfits to the general public helps to subsidise this.</p>
<p>We also take the magic of costumes to groups and individuals who experience disadvantage, providing creative dressing-up activities and interactive storytelling with children, and reminiscence sessions with older people. We share our skills, offering practical, fun sewing courses to children and young people, including those with learning disabilities and special educational needs.</p>
<p>Gladrags opening times:</p>
<p>by appointment: Tuesdays and Wednesdays 10am - 2pm; Thursdays 10am - 6pm.</p>

<p><strong>21 - 21 OUTREACH PROGRAMME</strong></p>
<p>To celebrate&nbsp;<strong>21 years of making a positive</strong>&nbsp;difference since April 1994, we are conjuring 21 meaningful projects and events aimed at communities in deprived areas of Sussex, between now and April 2015! Our experienced Outreach team have already begun the&nbsp;<strong>21-21</strong>&nbsp;programme&hellip;taking the magic of costumes to<strong>&nbsp;groups and individuals who experience disadvantage</strong>, providing:</p>
<ul>
<li>creative dressing-up activities and interactive storytelling with children living in poorer areas</li>
<li>practical, fun sewing courses to children and young people, including those with learning disabilities and special educational needs</li>
<li>reminiscence sessions with older people and those experiencing dementia</li>
</ul>
<p>All proceeds from the children's Costume Carnival will go towards achieving this goal. We need to raise &pound;3000 so if you'd like to help you can also donate during the festival, or right now via: https://<span style="text-decoration: underline;">mydonate</span>.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">bt</span>.com/charities/gladragscommunitycostumetrust&nbsp;</p>
