<p>Since its inception in 2009, Brighton Japan has become the largest outdoor Cosplay festival in the UK, attracting ever larger numbers of Cosplayers to its Pop Culture Weekend...</p>

<p>...but now it is about to get even bigger!</p>

<p>We are inviting Cosplayers, Gothic Lolitas, LARPers, and Steampunks - in fact anyone who loves to dress up and play - to take part in the world's first Costume Carnival to celebrate the opening weekend of the Rugby World Cup.</p>

<p>With the involvement of the award-winning Paraiso Schoolâ€¨ of Samba, the Costume Cosplay Carnival will be themed on "Superheroes." We are honoured to have some of the biggest names working today in costume design to help lead this project, including Graham Churchyard, Costume Special Effects Supervisor on the Batman and Harry Potter movies.</p>

<p>If you would like to get involved, please get in touch!</p>
