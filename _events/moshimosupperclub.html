<p>The Moshimo Supper Club is back!&nbsp;It's taken us ages to get the programme right, and we think it's going to be&nbsp;quite special: Clive Bell, one of the leading Shakuhachi players in the west will be performing, and there'll be a screening of one of the greatest Japanese movies: Woman of the Dunes (Suna no Onna). If you've seen this film before, it's definitely time to see this gem again. If you've never seen it, you've got a treat in store.</p>
<p>A five course dinner will be served by MOSHIMO.</p>
<p>Doors open: 7pm. Programme begins: 7.30pm. Tickets: &pound;40.</p>
