<p>Here's what my favourite film critic reviewer, Philip French, writes about the film:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The setting is Yokohama in 1963, the year before the Tokyo Olympics and a time of hope and social change for Japan. It focuses on an innocent love affair between two spirited high-school classmates, Umi and Shun. They're drawn together through a campaign to keep open their school's clubhouse for students' extramural activities, an institution run by the kids themselves that represents a link between fading traditions and the future. It transpires that their fathers, both seafarers, died in tragic circumstances, and this discovery proves a healing experience. It's a lively, touching story, full of sadness and optimism, drawn with an unaffected simplicity."</p>
