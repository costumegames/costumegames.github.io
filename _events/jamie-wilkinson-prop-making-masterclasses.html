<p>Jamie Wilkinson has been head of props on movies such as Clash of the Titans, Kick Ass 2 and The Dark Knight. He and his team will be giving a number of one hour workshops throughout the day. This workshop, starting at 1pm, will concentrate on creating a simple edge weapon with a Plastazote metal finish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This workshop is free, but is highly likely to be over-subcribed. If you wish to be able to book a place at this session, you will need to purchase a VIP Festival pass, which will give you free entry into all of the ticketed events (except for the MOSHIMO Supper Club) and will allow you to book at any of the free events.</p>
