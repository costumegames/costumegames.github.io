<p>She came to our last Brighton Japan festival, and we liked her so much we asked her back: the self-styled "Godmother of Japanese Electronica" will be playing her music and creating her amazing vibe as Lady Aiko completes her artwork and hopefully hundreds of people join us to build and create the Costume Gardens. It'll be quite a unique event, so we hope that you can join us!</p>
