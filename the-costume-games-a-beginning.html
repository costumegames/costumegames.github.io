    <meta name="description" content="When we set out on this journey to create The Costume Games, many months ago, we had no idea where it would take us.
&nbsp;
What we did know was that we are truly passionate about costume. Making, exploring, understanding, interpreting and celebrating, and, that Brighton would be the perfect place to share that passion.
&nbsp;
Why do we dress up? How can an outer shell have such a powerful effect on our inner self?
&nbsp;
We also knew, that to steer us on the right path, we would need someone who had lived and breathed costume, and importantly costume effects, for their entire career.
&nbsp;
Enter stage left Graham Churchyard. A man who has costume running through his veins, and currently works as Costume Effects supervisor on the biggest films being made in the world today.
&nbsp;
I had the very good fortune to first work for Graham on 'Batman Begins'. As time went on stories would start to emerge about the films that he had worked on and the costume creations he had been a part of. 'Legend', 'Batman', 'The Fifth Element'. He had been on set to watch a young Christian Bale make his first mark on 'Empire of The Sun', and was now several years later, pulling together the team that would help transform him into Chris Nolan's Batman. 
&nbsp;
We did not know how successful Chris Nolan would be in re-igniting the floundering Batman franchise, but we did know we were part of something special. The way our incarnation of Batman came to life to ignite the imaginations of so many people around the world&hellip;It was an amazing process to be part of.
&nbsp;
Rarely do we get a chance to truly share our passions and expertise beyond the boundaries of the industry in which we work, and to have the opportunity to be surrounded by those that are as passionate as we are, as well as to inspire those that have never even donned a cape, is unique and enriching.
&nbsp;
To reignite that child-like joy of costume as a form of escape, and to invite people to share that joy was why we decided to create The Costume Games. 
&nbsp;
Whoever you are and for whatever reason you love to dress up, we want to celebrate you and join together in what we hope will be a very special event.
